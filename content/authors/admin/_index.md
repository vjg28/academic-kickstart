I am a final year B.Tech student with majors in Electronics & Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Science & Engineering at **IIT Guwahati**. I work on problems at the intersection of **reinforcement learning** (RL) and **imitation learning**, finding new approaches and methods to combine both and solve challenging Robotics problems. Following my research interests, I did both summer research intenships in 2019 and 2018 in the field of Deep RL and Imitation Learning, where I worked under [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) at RISE Labs, IIT Madras and earlier with [Dr. Venkat Natarajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkat-natarajan-a9923414/?originalSubdomain=in) at Intel Labs. 

Aim for the stars- summarises my free time I spend with my telescope. Coming up to sports, I stood out as a two times National Champion & 5 times consecutive State champion in my nine years of Roller Skating career.

I also love trekking, solo-trips, cycling trips & going to unknown places. Although I don't do it that often anymore, please do ping me if you got some excellent trekking plans. :)
